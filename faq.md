# Why are you doing this?
I deeply care about transit in Madison and want the redesign to be a success. Letting riders (especially those with no easy access to smart phones or the internet) know where they have to go to catch a bus is a good thing.

# Why isn't Metro doing this?
There are hundreds of stops that will close, and putting up individualized maps at all of them is logistically challenging. The one thing worse than a bad sign is an incorrect sign.

# Any tips?
The pdf files are in color, but they should also work okay when printed in B/W. If you access to a laminator, that'll greatly improve the longevity of the sign. If lamination is too expensive, you could use plastic sheet protectors. For installing the sign at the bus stop, it may be helpful to use zip ties (for laminated signs). Don't cover official signage; don't create a mess that Metro needs to clean up. 

# The info on the map I downloaded is wrong. What do I do?
Send me an [email](mailto:kliems@gmail.com) with the stop ID and what is wrong.

# Can't you add ... to the signs? 
Maybe? Put a request on Github and I'll take a look.
