Madison Metro's network is changing. On June 11, the redesigned network, with all new routes will start. This means a simpler network and faster service. 

It also means that a lot of stops will be closing. To help people navigate those closures, this is a volunteer effort to create and put up meaningful signage at the closed stops. Here's how it works:

1. You notice a stop closing sign in your neighborhood. 
2. Write down or take a picture of the 4-digit stop number.
3. Download the pdf file for that stop.
4. Print the sign.
5. Install the sign at the bus stop.

# Why are we doing this?
We deeply care about transit in Madison and want the redesign to be a success. Letting riders (especially those with no easy access to smart phones or the internet) know where they have to go to catch a bus is a good thing.

# Why isn't Metro doing this?
We don't know. There are hundreds of stops that will close, and maybe they don't have the staff capacity.

# Any tips?
The pdf files are in color, but they should also work okay when printed in B/W. If you access to a laminator, that'll greatly improve the longevity of the sign. For installing the sign at the bus stop, it may be helpful to use zip ties (for laminated signs). Technically you're probably not supposed to put up signs at a bus stop (vandalism!).

# Can't you add ... to the signs? 
Maybe? Put a request on Github and I'll take a look.
